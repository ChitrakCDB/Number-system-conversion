# Number-system-conversion


In this project you will find 
1. binary to hexadecimal,decimal and octal conversion.
2. decimal to binary,hexadecimal and octal conversion.
3. octal to decimal,hexadecimal and binary conversion
4. hexadecimal to octal,binary and decimal conversion.


the first function will convert decimal to binary value
in it n % 2 gives remainder and n is divided by 2.
the for lop will execute until the value becomes 1.
and the value will be printed from MSB to LSB.


the second function converts decimal to octal values.
in it n is divided by 8 and its % gives value
and the number is printed from MSB to LSB using count.


the third function converts deccimal to hexadecimal.
the same things will be done but we will do it with 16 and after it  the type casting is done.

the fourth function convert binary to decimal is this 
the base will be multiplied with the individual decimal value.

the fifth function is conversion from binary to octal 
the values will be multiplied by 8.
then convert decimal to octal


in sixth binary to hexadecimal
multiplied by 16 then convert decimal to hexa decimal

in next functions the conversion will be done by either dividing if it is to be converted in binary
and multiplication if the conversion is foor decimal


the switch case will work according to input in main function and the remaining three values will be displayed
